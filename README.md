# Matrix
This is a matrix library coded in Python language.
it should do as much as numpy library do. I am still working on it, so that until now, it can do the following:
  1- Add, Subtract and Multiply matrices
  2- Find the inverse of a squre matrix
  3- Find the pseudoinverse of any matrix m * n
  4- Find the solution(s) for any line.
